# Changelog

All notable changes to the Stellar Insured Soroban Contracts project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Standardized error handling across the contract suite (#50):
  - `policy`, `risk_pool`, `governance`, `slashing`, `bridge`, and `escrow`
    (Soroban) now define typed `#[contracterror]` enums (`PolicyError`,
    `RiskPoolError`, `GovernanceError`, `SlashingError`, `BridgeError`,
    `EscrowError`) and return `Result<T, Error>` from every entry point,
    matching the `claims` contract's existing pattern and the ink! insurance
    contract's `InsuranceError` model. Human-readable `panic!("...")` strings
    are no longer stored in the WASM binary or encoded in revert data.
  - `OwnershipTransfer.sol`, `InitializationGuard.sol`, `InputValidation.sol`,
    and `FallbackHandler.sol` now revert with the centralized `Errors`
    library from `ContractErrors.sol` instead of inline `require(..., "...")`
    strings; two missing error variants (`ZeroValueTransfer`,
    `TransferFailed`) were added to the library for `FallbackHandler`.
  - Fixed `libs.sol`'s `GovernanceManager`, which referenced nonexistent
    `./errors/ContractErrors.sol` and `./storage/StorageDefinitions.sol`
    imports and did not compile; it now imports the real `ContractErrors.sol`.
  - Converged `src/lib.rs`'s duplicate `GovernanceManager` (a raw
    `require()` string) onto the same `Errors` library pattern as `libs.sol`.
